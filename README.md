# Docker NodeJS Project
 
Project created in a university workshop where a web application deployment with NodeJS and Dockers is implemented.

The container is automatically updated and uploaded to dockerhub with each commit, where an image of dockerhub was created....

The complete code was not created by me, credits to my teacher Javier Manzanares who provided it to us.
